		The analytic–synthetic distinction (also called the analytic–synthetic dichotomy) is a conceptual distinction, used primarily in philosophy to distinguish propositions (in particular, statements that are affirmative subject–predicate judgments) into two types: analytic propositions and synthetic propositions. Analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world. 

		分析-综合二分是一种概念区分，主要在哲学上用以将命题（更具体的，是肯定的主谓判断陈述）分为两类：分析命题和综合命题。
		
		分析命题靠其自身的意义为真。(e.g. 人皆会死)
		综合命题靠其自身的意义与世界的关系为真。（e.g. Python是最受欢迎的语言）
