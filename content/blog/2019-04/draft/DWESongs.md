Twas the night before DWEs and in Sitterson Hall
not a student was stirring, not one soul at all

The workstations hummed with cycles to spare
while students crammed madly back in their lairs

The students then nested all snug in their beds
While visions of DWE questions danced in their heads

And what in their nightmarish dreams should appear
But nine questions from Hell on subjects they feared

On VM!  On TMs!  On UNION/FIND trees!
On parsing!  On caching!  On Taylor series!

To the heart of the problem!  To these questions we call!
Now write away, write away, write away all!

A blink of both eyes and the scratching of heads
Soon gave them to know they had everything to dread

The wording -- how vague!  The subjects -- arcane!
With problems that showed them a new world of pain!

A 45 point essay on reducing disk seeks!
The 151 question was written in Greek!

But then in a twinkling they heard near their heads
The sound of alarm clocks rousing them from their beds

The noise from the clocks gave off such a clatter
They sprang from their beds to see what was the matter

Far faster than eagles the students they flew
(At 12 noon bus rides are numbering few)

They rushed to their cars and rushed to their bikes
And came back to Sitterson, (oh yeah -- some chose to hike)

They said not a word but went straight to their work
Picked up their packets and turned with a jerk

And filling their mugs with caffeine (I suppose)
Then taking a sip, up the stairs they rose!

And off to their offices they flew like before
"Do not Disturb" signs appeared on their doors

But they heard me exclaim ere they vanished from sight
"Good luck on the writtens!  May you get 70% right!"
