=> Who should read this document?

     The object of this paper is to discuss the Oral exams and how to 
     prepare for them.  It is aimed at the doctoral student getting 
     ready for Orals, in the hopes that he or she will avoid some 
     mistakes that those of us who already went through it made.

     Orals are not required for pure M.S. students, so they need not 
     read this document.

=> What makes you an authority on this subject?

     Nothing, other than having taken and passed the Orals, discussing 
     the subject with several other students and professors, and having 
     a desire to share my experiences with others.  As any reader of 
     the previous Hitchhiker guides should know, this is an entirely 
     unofficial guide, not sanctioned by the Department or guaranteed 
     in any fashion to be correct.  You assume all risk in following 
     the suggestions in this guide.  But if it works, I want a 5% cut 
     in your pay raise after you pass. :-)

=> Ok, I understand.  Now just one question.

     Sure, name it.

=> Just what the heck are "Orals?"

     Thought you were home free after the DWE?  Not quite.  The Doctoral 
     Oral Exam is the last chance the Faculty has to kick you out of the 
     Department.  (There's the Defense, but I've never heard of a student 
     failing the Defense.)  You must take them and pass as part of the 
     requirements for the Ph.D. 

=> When do Orals occur?

     Unlike the DWE, the Oral exam is an individual affair.  You must 
     schedule the test yourself, anytime after you have finished the 
     Ph.D. course requirements and have a committee assembled.  Thus, 
     it can occur anytime during the year.  Ask Janet Jones for the form 
     "Departmental Request For Student Permit To Take Second Doctoral
     Examination."  You're supposed to submit that form a few weeks 
     before you actually take Orals, although I have heard of students 
     filling it out on the day of the exam...

=> Don't I need to have a topic approved first?

     You need not have passed your Ph.D. proposal before taking Orals, 
     although that's how it's usually been done in the graphics group.  
     All you need is a committee and a basic idea of the area where you 
     want to do your dissertation.  The test might be easier if you take 
     it before proposal rather than after, since the topics will be 
     broader and simpler.  It's something to consider.

=> Ok, I've decided to take it.  What am I up against?

     The Oral exam consists of your committee questioning you for up to 
     3 hours on several topics that are strongly related to your 
     dissertation area.  As the name suggests, both the questions and 
     answers are given orally.  You should not depend on written notes.  
     For each topic, one professor acts as a primary griller, but any 
     other professor can jump in and ask supplementary questions.  
     (It's important to remember that although one professor interrogates 
     you at a time, five or more are listening, so don't tailor your 
     answers solely to the one who asked the question.)  Generally, 
     you're expected to stand during the test and answer the questions 
     or work out problems on the white board.  The length of each session 
     varies, depending on the number of topics you have.  After the 
     test, your committee kicks you out of the room to decide whether or
     not you passed.  At least two-thirds must vote in your favor for 
     a pass (although the vote is generally unanimous).  You learn their 
     verdict immediately afterwards.

=> What if I don't pass?

     If you don't pass, you get another chance.  After a minimum three 
     month wait, you can retake the test.  If you fail the second 
     attempt, you have to petition to get a third shot, and you better 
     have a champion on the Faculty willing to fight for you.

=> What is the pass rate?

     Orals are not generally a weeder, in the way that the DWE is.  
     However, recently the pass rate on the first attempt has only been 
     around 50%, which seems rather low.  I know one person who failed 
     on the second attempt and unfortunately had to leave the Department, 
     and another who took it three times and passed on the third attempt.  
     So while most people eventually pass, it's not a cakewalk.
     
=> What are the topics?

     Unlike the DWE, which has nine common areas that every student is 
     responsible for, each Oral exam varies from student to student.  
     For example, my topic areas were:

          Interactive 3D computer graphics
          Virtual Environments
          Head tracking
          Math for predictive tracking
          Experimental design (at an introductory level)

     You negotiate with your committee on the number of topics and the 
     topic areas.  Since your topics will differ from mine and from 
     every other Ph.D. student's, this guide cannot cover topic contents!

=> Oh, great.  What can you help me with, then?

     I can provide tips on picking and negotiating topics.  Five seems 
     to be the typical number of topics, perhaps because you need a 
     minimum of five committee members.  In general, you want to 
     minimize the number of topics, since that reduces the amount of 
     studying you need to do.  A friend of mine had nine topics and 
     didn't pass Orals on his first try.  In retrospect, he termed having
     nine topics as "sheer suicide" and wished that he had fought harder 
     to reduce the number to something more manageable.

     Generate your list of topics by thinking about the areas linked to 
     your dissertation -- what subjects do you need to master in order 
     to successfully complete your dissertation?  These are the areas to 
     pick as topics.  Start small.  Submit a reasonable list to your 
     committee and force them to add subjects to that, rather than
     suggesting additions yourself.  It's easy for the list to grow if 
     you ask "Should I know something about such-and-such?"  (There's no 
     end to subjects that it would be nice to know something about!)  
     Instead, force your committee to justify any increases beyond your 
     reasonable starting point.  If you're lucky, there won't be any.

     Also, keep the size of the subject areas manageable.  If you can 
     reasonably make your topic "Real-time operating systems" instead 
     of just "Operating systems," you'll have less ground to cover.  
     Note that one of my topics was "Interactive 3D computer graphics," 
     not just plain "Computer graphics."  The downside is that you may be
     expected to have more expert knowledge than you would on a very 
     broad subject area, but that's often a tradeoff worth making.  If 
     you take Orals before passing proposal, your topic areas will 
     probably be broader than if you have a proposal in hand.  But 
     the questions you get will be more general as well.

     Interdisciplinary dissertations are a big problem.  Getting 
     "Chemistry" or "Psychology" as a topic is insane!  Not only must 
     you narrow it down from that, you also need to acquire a 
     significant knowledge base from another field in short order.  
     It's something to think about before diving into that 
     interdisciplinary topic.  I had only one topic that I knew very 
     little about before beginning Orals studying (Experimental Design).

=> Ok, I have my topics settled.  How long should I study?

     Some people walk right into the test with no preparation.  A few 
     have passed that way.  I don't recommend trying it, though.  I 
     have heard rumors that some members of the Faculty, when faced with 
     a student who waltzes in with no preparation, will ask harder 
     questions with the specific purpose of keeping the student's ego 
     in check (since you have got to be pretty damn cocky to do such 
     a thing!)

     Obviously, the preparation period is going to vary greatly, but 
     two months seems to be the typical timeframe.  Some mix in regular 
     work with that, and others withdraw completely and do nothing but 
     study, but two months is typical.
     
     Unless your background is particularly strong before you start 
     studying, you're going to need time to acquire and read the 
     important and representative papers in each topic.  Factor that 
     into your estimate of preparation time.

     Overall, I think I spent more hours studying for the Orals than 
     each of my attempts at the DWE!  But this preparation should help 
     you in your dissertation work, so it's hardly wasted time.

=> What should I study?  I don't have any practice questions!

     This is an important dilemma.  To give a thorough answer, we 
     need to look at the philosophy behind the Orals. (Much of this 
     is based on conversations with Dr. Brooks, Dr. Fuchs, and other 
     professors.)

     Your committee wants you to succeed, but will not give you a free 
     ride.  This is the basic mindset of your executioners going into 
     the exam.  Deep down, they are on your side and want nothing more 
     than to pass you.  If this isn't true, you need to pick a new 
     committee!  But you must achieve a basic standard of performance 
     before they can do so with a clean conscience.

     What does they want out of Orals, besides fulfilling the 
     requirement of the 2nd doctoral test mandated by the Graduate 
     School?  Two things:

          1) Does this student have the proper background to
             successfully complete his dissertation research?

          2) Is this student able to field and answer questions
             smoothly and competently enough that he or she
             won't embarrass the Department after graduation
             during interviews, presentations, etc.?

     You may get a wide distribution of questions, ranging from extremely 
     simple to devilishly tricky.  But based on these two goals, the 
     ones you have to watch out for are basic questions and questions 
     relating directly to your dissertation.  If a professor asks you 
     some highly specific question on something only superficially 
     related to what you're doing, then you have a chance to impress your
     committee, but if you can't answer it, it's not a big deal.  In 
     fact, the other committee members may get after that professor for 
     asking such an esoteric question.  But if you get asked a basic 
     question, or one that is directly related to your dissertation topic, 
     and you can't answer it, that looks *bad*.  Really bad.  This is 
     the kind of thing you must avoid to convince your committee that 
     you can satisfy requirement #2.  So the Two Commandments of orals
     preparation are:

          1) Thou shalt master the *fundamentals* of thy topics 
             before studying the esoterics.

          2) Thou shalt know all of the problems with thy
             dissertation and be prepared to answer questions
             on them.

     If you take Orals before passing proposal, then Commandment #2 
     becomes more general: knowing the important problems within the 
     area you want to do your dissertation in.

     If you do a good job in following these Two Commandments, you stand 
     a decent chance in anticipating the most likely questions that will 
     get thrown at you.  I think a big factor in my success during the 
     Orals was giving good answers to several questions -- because I 
     had thought of them before the test and spent some time beforehand
     thinking them through!

=> Great.  But I still don't have any practice questions!

     Get a study group together with other students who share similar 
     topic areas.  Ask professors to come in and grill you with questions 
     in a mock oral exam.  That will help expose you to the style of 
     questions.  (Note: most, but not all professors are willing to do 
     this.)  It's usually ok to ask members of your committee to do this,
     although I had mine grill me on different subject areas from the 
     ones they would cover in the real exam.

     Previous orals are loosely transcribed and kept as part of a student's 
     record.  Ask a student in a similar field who already took the test 
     if he could describe the questions he had to answer.

     Questions usually follow a typical trend.  The professor generally 
     has a basic plan of attack for the areas he wants to probe you on.  
     It starts out with a broad and simple question, and eventually 
     narrows down to a specific area or problem.  Along the way, the 
     professor will think of other questions, based on your responses, 
     and may pursue various aspects of such side issues before returning 
     to the main thrust of the question.  It's not unusual to run out
     of time before he can get to the ultimate point he wanted to ask 
     you about!

     Unfortunately, terminology is part of what you must know to convince 
     your committee that you are competent.  This leads to what I call 
     "read my mind" questions -- you talk about some phenomenon 
     and then a prof asks you, "And what is the word we use for this?"  
     I hate those.

=> I'm not used to oral exams.  What can I do?

     If your education was like mine, you had very few oral tests.  
     Written tests are simply more efficient; it's tough for a professor 
     to individually quiz each student in a class of 200!  Through high 
     school, undergrad, and grad school, I had a total of two oral exams 
     before the big one.  This lack of experience leads to justifiable
     anxiety.

     Oral exams are fundamentally different from written tests.  On the 
     DWE, you can flounder on a question for 40 minutes, then get a 
     flash of inspiration, and madly scribble down the answer in 5 
     minutes.  Or you can write an answer, come back to it, realize 
     that you were an idiot, erase it and write down the correct answer.  
     Neither of these options are available on an oral test.  Once a 
     question is posed, you've got between 10 and 60 seconds to think 
     before a professor will try to prod you in some way to help you
     find the answer.

     Then again, an oral test offers advantages that are unavailable on 
     written tests.  If you're not sure what a question is asking, or 
     you need to make assumptions, you can get immediate feedback from 
     the questioner.  You can communicate in ways other than words -- by 
     using hand gestures, body language, voice inflection, and drawings 
     on the white board that you can modify while the professors watch.

     Part of the test is how well can you present yourself in front of a 
     group of people.  It's not just a measure of whether you know your 
     stuff, it's how well you can communicate.  *How* you answer a 
     question is about as important as the content of your answer.  If 
     you're not a confident speaker, it's worth some effort to get
     practice before the Orals.

     If you're not used to oral tests, how can you prepare for them?  
     One way is to teach a class.  You have to do that as part of the 
     Ph.D. requirements anyway.  It gives you practice thinking on your 
     feet and on clearly explaining difficult subjects.  Another is to 
     give presentations, either informally within the Department or better 
     yet, externally at a conference.  Answering the questions after your 
     talk will give you practice under fire.  Running demos to 
     technically sophisticated audiences also proved to be helpful 
     practice for me.  This is especially true when the audience is 
     formed of big shots, since they ask blunt, difficult questions, and 
     they're smart enough to reject a bad answer from you.  Finally, get 
     professors in to grill you in mock orals.  (I don't recommend 
     having fellow students do practice grilling, since they tend not 
     to probe deeply enough, which can inspire a false sense of
     security in the victim.)

=> What else did you learn about oral exams?

     Use the white board.  Bring in your own magic markers; do not rely 
     on the ones at the board (they may be dried out).  It helps both 
     you and your professors if you write down part of your answer on 
     the board.  You can also buy a few seconds of time to think by 
     sketching something out on the board.

     You will probably get to pick which professor asks which topic, and 
     the order in which the topics get covered.  Other times, the profs 
     will kick you out of the room right before the exam to settle those 
     two questions.  Be psychologically ready for that to happen.

     Assigning topics to professors is usually easy -- match the expert 
     to the particular subject.  The order of topics is a more 
     interesting issue.  Multiple strategies exist.  You can place the 
     subject you fear most at the end, in the hopes that you do well 
     in the previous ones and run out of time during the last one.  On 
     the other hand, if you're borderline until then, the anchor subject
     could decide your fate.  The first subject should be one that you 
     think has the least likelihood of derailing you by presenting a
     question that you just can't handle.  It's important to get at 
     least one topic under your belt, to gain some confidence and build 
     momentum.  I put my best subject right in the middle, in the hope 
     of snowballing early momentum.  Decide what strategy works best 
     for you.

     You get at least one bathroom break, so if you're running
     into real difficulties, call time out and regroup.  

     In learning the basics, don't forget the *basic* basics!  I had 
     several pages of notes on basic trig, calculus, linear algebra, 
     physics, probability, statistics, and the like.  Since you can't 
     rely on written notes during the test, I spent more time remembering 
     how to rederive formulas rather than memorizing them.  I might not 
     have remembered what the Taylor expansion of sin(x) was, but you 
     can rederive it if you remember the basic expression for a Taylor 
     series.  During a practice session, I forgot what the Fourier 
     transform of a triangle function is, but was able to rederive it.  
     At least one professor I know is infamous for making his students 
     work out math on the white board.

     When you get a question, especially at the *start* of a session, 
     make sure you understand the question before blithely spouting out 
     an answer.  Initial questions are often vague and depend on unstated 
     assumptions.  If Steve Weiss asks you how to do sorting, you 
     probably should ask him *what* you're sorting.  If Fred Brooks 
     wants you to draw the graphics pipeline, first find out what 
     rendering technique he has in mind!

     Such interchanges to find out what the professor really wants will 
     impress the committee, but make sure you're doing it to find out 
     what *he* wants, not to steer the question in the direction *you* want!  
     The professor is in charge during the exam and will cover the areas 
     he is interested in.  This can be frustrating at times, since
     they tend to quit probing you on a subject that you're doing well 
     on and move on to something else that you might not know so well, 
     but that's the way the game is played.  If you attempt to sidestep 
     or steer away from the posed question, your committee will not be 
     pleased.

     If you're not sure of an answer, qualify it.  If you really don't 
     know the answer, say so.  An inability to say "I don't know" at 
     the *proper* times will get you into trouble, especially if your 
     professor is trying to determine how deep your knowledge is!  
     Trying to bluff your way past the limits of your knowledge is not 
     going to work when your committee has far more expertise than you do.
     A much better response is something like "Well, I'm not really sure, 
     but my intuition tells me..." followed by your educated guess.

     At the same time, I've also seen a tendency in students to give 
     up too easily, to say "I don't know" far too quickly.  There's 
     nothing wrong with shutting up and thinking for a minute, or in 
     taking 30 seconds out to work something out on the board before 
     giving your answer.  If a question needs some CPU time, don't 
     be afraid to crunch on it for a while.  Not every question that 
     the professors give to you has an obvious and immediate answer 
     -- they expect you to think about some of them.  Being able to 
     recognize those takes practice and experience.  If you eventually 
     can't find a solution, then say so, but don't give up without a 
     fight.

     The ability to tailor the length of the response based on the 
     difficulty of the question seems to be something that certain 
     professors look for.  This takes judgement and educated guesswork.  
     During the exam, I think I was able to sense which questions were 
     simple and which were difficult.  For the simple ones, they expected
     concise and direct responses.  But on the difficult ones, they 
     expected some thought and analysis, which requires more time.  
     Giving a long answer to a simple question or a brief answer to 
     something that demands several minutes of analysis first will make 
     you look bad.  I found this out the hard way when I hesitated on
     a simple question on transforms (fearing that it was a trick 
     question).  That earned me five more minutes of grilling on that 
     subject before my professor moved on to something else.  You should 
     also avoid "core dump" answers where you spew out everything you
     know on the question and everything related to it. Only give the 
     relevant information to the question at hand, not everything you 
     know about related fields as well.

     In general, your professors would like to see evidence that your 
     knowledge of the topics goes beyond sheer memorization and 
     booklearning.  If time and energy permit, your study program should 
     not be just reading papers.  Work out some problems, try 
     implementing some of the algorithms, or play with some 
     applications.  Discuss the area with other advanced students in 
     your field.  Go to conferences and exhibitions.  Supplementing 
     your reading with hands-on experience is the best way to build 
     intuition.  Some of the answers I gave in my exam came from 
     attending SIGGRAPHs and actually building things, rather than 
     anything I read.

     Work out research problems on your own.  Play "what if?" games by 
     changing some key parameter and then seeing how that will affect 
     design decisions.  While the odds of picking a question that you'll 
     get asked during the real thing is very low, the practice will 
     sharpen your skills.

     Keep attending research meetings within the Department.  I didn't 
     think it a good idea to completely cut myself from Department 
     meetings while studying for Orals, since the problems that rise 
     from the meetings can give you food for thought.  They can also 
     inspire a question that one of your professors might ask you (it 
     has happened!) so you can think of it as self-protection as well.

     Cultivate estimation skills.  The ability to do back-of-the-envelope 
     calculations is very useful.  Let's say computer or human vision 
     is one of your topics.  You better know the resolution of the human 
     eye, in terms of degrees of arc.  But let's assume you forgot that 
     fact.  Could you estimate it?  Can you think of a situation where 
     you can barely recognize something at a long distance?  How
     about looking at an 18-wheel truck from an airplane?  If you know 
     typical cruising altitudes (around 35,000 feet) and the length of 
     the truck (perhaps 40 feet?) you can get a decent estimate of the 
     eye's resolving power.  Doing ballpark estimation is helpful in 
     doing quick analyses on whether something is feasible or not.  Try 
     some of the following as exercises:

          * How many bytes would it take to store the Library
            of Congress?  What if we only store the text
            and not the pictures?

          * What is the total drainage of the Mississipi river
            per year, in cubic meters?

          * How many barbers are there in the United States?

          * How many FLOPS does it take to animate 100,000
            triangles at 30 Hz?

          * What bandwidth is needed to ship live video
            digitally from 4 widely-separated sites so each 
            site can see the other three?  How much can
            compression help?  Can our existing communications
            infrastructure meet the requirements?

          * How many minutes will it take the image processing
            group to fill up 10 Gigabytes of disk space? :-)

     If you're struggling with a question, your professors will try to 
     help you by giving a hint or prodding you in the right direction.  
     There's nothing wrong with needing a hint or a push now and then, 
     so don't be afraid to ask for help occasionally.  But some 
     students prefer to contemplate a problem without outside 
     interference until they reach a solution.  For those students, 
     these well-intended hints only serve to break their concentration
     and destroy their train of thought.  If you are one of these, 
     discuss this with your committee before the exam.  If you request 
     it, your committee will probably agree not to give any hints or 
     prodding until you explicitly ask for them.

     What does it take to pass?  The unofficial grapevine says that you 
     should do very well on at least one topic.  Screwing up one topic 
     is ok if you perform adequately on all the others.  Screwing up 
     two topics will sink you.  If you fail your first attempt, be 
     absolutely certain that you are bulletproof on the questions that 
     were asked in that first test.  According to one professor,
     there's no shame in doing badly the first time, but if you can't 
     handle the same question on the second attempt, your professors 
     will be very disappointed in you.

=> Any other comments?

     Scheduling the exam can be one of the harder parts of the test, if 
     you have committee members who travel often.  It's not always easy 
     getting five professors into the same room for three straight hours!  
     If you think you'll run into such problems, schedule your exam well 
     in advance.

     I brought in a bike canteen, since I get thirsty when talking too 
     much.  I also had a calculator, which I was allowed to use.  While 
     I brought in my binder of notes, I never referred to them during 
     the exam.  You may be allowed to look at written references during
     the test, but ask permission first, and do not do so very often.  
     You normally don't have such material available during interviews 
     or when answering questions after presentations, so don't rely on 
     them during Orals.

     The notes on mental attitude and on avoiding burnout from the DWE
     guide also apply to the Orals.

=> Thanks for the tips.  But what was that pay raise you
   mentioned earlier?

     After you pass both Orals and proposal, your stipend increases by 
     $500 per semester.  It's not much, but any little bit helps.

     Good luck!
