	On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday this week, over 20 of our fellow
students will be undergoing the rite-of-passage known as the DWE.  To help
them through this difficult period, we list some suggested actions to take:

	* If a person is taking the DWE in an office next to yours, make sure
	  you turn up the volume on your boom box so he can be inspired by
	  the latest heavy metal music.  Similarly, if you want to chat with
	  a friend, hold your conversation out in the hallway outside the 
	  office of a DWE-taker.

	* If you know a DWE-taker, call her at home around 1 am to ask her 
	  how the previous day's questions were and if she's been getting
	  enough sleep before each session.

	* When you run into one of them in the stairwells, DWE packet
	  in hand, going to or from his office, make sure to stop him and 
	  chat about UNC's victory over Temple and what our chances for 
	  the national championship are.

	* When you see a sign on a door saying "Taking DWE.  Go away or
	  you die!" make sure to knock on her door to offer your support.
	  Better yet, call her on the phone.  Let the phone ring 10 or 15
	  times.

	We thank you for your support.  And to the DWE-takers: good luck.

"Can you operate it, Spock?"

"Well, Jim, this computer was designed and constructed 300 
million years ago by a totally alien race of methane-breathing,
squidlike beings who built it using technologies unknown to 
us and used it for purposes we cannot conceive of and then 
mysteriously vanished, leaving no shred of documentation as
to its operation.  It may take a few moments."
